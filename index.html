  <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>

    Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror game where you play a security     guard in Freddy's Pizzeria. This is a restaurant entertained by           animatronics, which were made by the serial killer William Afton. After murdering 5 children, their souls attatched themselves to the animatronics, posessing them. Believing that any human is their murderer, they go on rampage during the night to seek revenge.
    In the game, you have to survive the night by keeping out posessed animatronics.If the animatronics reach you, you will die. game over. each animatronics have certain ways of keeping them at bay, and if your power for the protection runs out, its game over. when Five Nights at Fredddy's was released, it was a hit, especially as not many games at the time had restricted movement. but this adds a very special element to the game and helps with the tension of gameplay

  You sit in first person view if the security guards office. there are two metal doors each side of you, opened and closed by a button. each door is equipped with a light. You also have access to security cameras, so you can see if the animatronics move and where they are in relation to the security office. These show the Pizzeria's map (see right), and you can select each room to access the cameras. When an animatronic(s) move, the cameras will cut and turn back on again, showing them in their new position.
